# Chernoff-Project
This is the final project of CS 533 (Image Processing) at UW Madison. The project involves manipulating real world images to change the emotions of the subject. Additionally in Part II of the project, we perform sentiment analysis on twitter data and then display the sentiment as a Chernoff face.

A Chernoff face is a simple sketch of a human face that is parameterized by a few variables. By manipulating the variables, it is possible to achieve a wide range of expressions.
The aim of this project is to simulate Chernoff Faces on real world images. We can manipulate the variables to change the expresions of the subject and simulate anger, surprise, sadness and happiness.

Part I of the project involves creating a simple Chernoff Face on the real world image.
Part II of the project involves extracting the real time tweets from twitter based on a hashtag and then classify the tweet's emotion using a Markov classifier.
We then display the emotion using a Chernoff face on the real time image.
